## How to build and run this app.

It is assumed that you have the following installed in your machine:
- npm (I'll recommend install node as npm would be auto install along) and 
- git (optional)

```
- If using git, then git clone https://github.com/leewaygroups/webrelief-podcast.git else download and 
	unzip file,  Cd to the root directory (where package.json is located).
- run `npm install` 

```

Install [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) to effortlessly launch the application on your browser.

To install [live-server]:

```
npm install -g live-server
live-server --open=app
```
